# MARS

TrapezoidParametersAnalysis & TrapezoidParametersAnalysis_Calibrated do not make sense because the parameters were set wrong. Nevertheless I leave the code here because it may contain useful lines.

PSDTest & PHATest are the code used to analyze the first measurements with the corresponding firmware.

PHAGain & PHAChannels study the system resolution when changing the gain / number of channels.
